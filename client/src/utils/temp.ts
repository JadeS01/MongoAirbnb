It's exactly same as the pictures, super clean, large enough for 1 or 2 person and you need only 3 mins walk from the Museum Station. It's also close to the mart, convenience store and easy to take a taxi. What I love the most is that it's just near the Hyde Park. It means that you could walk there every morning and night with beautiful view. And comfortable bed, clean and large shower booth, big screen TV with Samsung Smart-hub, big dinning table... everything in room was ready for your perfect trip. In addition, Desireé is really kind, good-hearted host. I couldn't meet her but she always answer kindly to my messages and give help everytime :D Don't miss this room!! "

The apartment was immaculate and really did provide a home away from home. You could seriously just turn up at his place as everything is provided for the guest's use. Desiree thought of all the little special touches - from fresh fruit and sparkling water to chocolates and flowers.  The location is fantastic - walking distance to all that Sydney has to offer.   Her guide book and restaurant recommendations were wonderful.  Highly recommended  - better than any hotel stay!  We  will be back again!  Many thanks Desiree"

Desireé was a wonderful host and had some lovely touches such as stocking the fridge with beers and provided snacks, fruit and milk etc. the bathroom was also stocked with products and didn't even need to use my own shampoo etc. We also were allowed an early check in and a late check out which was just amazing.

She was wonderfully generous with items left in the fridge for me to help myself to, and even some lovely fresh flowers for me on arrival. It's a gorgeous apartment right in the hub of the city BUT with the bedroom double glazed I had some of the best nights sleeps here I've had in ages. Terrific stay. Best part? Uber wide screen Tv and free NETFLIX! I loved this apartment. Don't hesitate to book."

We also loved the ARTERY gallery, and bought some nice gifts for friends back home and even a cool painting that I could carry on to the plane.  Overall a great experience and a perfect spot to end our trip to Australia in style."

The hotel rooms get marked down for being dated in reviews on hotel sites, but this apartment certainly isn't.  It's centrally located: it has Darlinghurst's little strip of restaurants just around the corner, and central Sydney equally close in the other direction.  I was here for a week in March and it (unusually) rained every day, so the 60\" UHD Samsung smart TV with Netflix and Stan (Aussie streaming), as well as Apple TV, was particularly welcome, as was the small gym on the roof.  The pool was less useful, but would be great normally.  Desireé is a very friendly host too.  Highly recommended."

It hosts beautiful city views, a quick 5 minute walk to Museum rail station, and a hop to great restaurants and nightlife. The apartment is tastefully decorated with art and books from adventurous travels; furnished and accessorized with absolutely everything that I could require, plus more. I was impressed at the Desireé's thoughtfulness in accommodating her guests needs. Such things as a kind welcome note. Petite chocolates, mini fresh milk packs in the fridge, expresso machine and every conceivable toiletry item one could need inside a bathroom cabinet. Discreetly rolled up extension cords so you never have to look for one to reach the wall socket to charge your digital devices. The bed was comfortable, where sprigs of fragrant lavender greeted us laid upon freshly rolled up towels. We loved our stay and highly recommend Desireé as a host. She communicated well, was always polite and prompt with messaging all required information upon booking. There's no doubt why Desireé has been voted as a super host. You will be delighted."

There is a guest laundry in the building with coin operated machines and you can do a big wash and dry for $4 each.  The apartment is bright and airy and has a nice busy city outlook which we enjoyed.  You can certainly hear the buzz of the city around you but you are right in the CBD so that is to be expected and enjoyed.  The location is fantastic.  You can walk to just about everything in the city centre and trains and buses are only metres away if you want to get around more quickly or go further afield.  Very easy access from the airport by train into Museum station. The host, Desiree, was a pleasure to deal with, excellent communication all the way through.  This is a wonderful little home away from home putting you right into centre of the Sydney action."

It continued with an immaculate unit that provided us an oasis from our sight seeing. We use Airbnb quite a bit and especially enjoy being able to have a kitchen area for a quick breakfast or meal and morning coffee. The unit was close to grocery, public transport and amenities were as if I had lived there. We were there to celebrate my spouse's 50th birthday and were pleasantly surprised by the nice and thoughtful birthday card. Thank you again and we had a blast!"

You are also on subway routes too!\n\nThe home is quiet even though the street and park are well used.  It feels super safe to walk in.\n\nThere are great grocery and restaurant options right here...and we were hooked on Greenhouse Coffee just a few blocks down to start our day. We enjoyed the Sydney Festival and walked to their events and free activities. \n\nThe home had lots of lovely touches and thoughtful additions in the bath, the kitchen and a nice collection of books and info."

He was also very responsive to additional questions. The residence service at the counter was also good and the blokes were helpful. The apartment is clean and spacious, although it could do with a couple of extra basic necessities particularly in the kitchen. \r\n\r\nHowever, two main things made this experience rather average instead of great.\r\n- I reserved a flat with TWO bedrooms and only got one. I complained and they relocated me to a bigger apartment with two separate beds, but still ONE bedroom.  Upon booking make sure to confirm its two bedrooms you sign up to.\r\n\r\n- Saturday seemed to be national construction day which meant 8am rise and shine. sunday there was activity too although less loud. Normally not a problem but not great when you experienced some of the Istanbul night life the night before. A notice about this at least would have been great."

This was really welcoming. He showed us the apartment, which was perfectly clean and felt right away as a comfortable home. \r\nIn the fridge Manuala left us milk and her husband picked out an outstanding local port! \r\nThe ocean is less than a two minut walk and there are some great (fish) restaurants around the corner. \r\nThank you for everything Manuela, when ever we come back to Portugal we will make sure to visit your lovely apartment!"

You cant beat the location of this apartment anywhere in the city. Just enough distance away from the tourists, and easy walk to subway, bars, and great restaurants. Will definitely book this place again. "

It is far enough out to be relaxing but still close enough to go to Time Square and many other attractions. The apartment was nice and a great fit for my family of 3. Would recommend staying here."

She was just a text away at any time & checked in to be sure we got in/out with ease. That made our stay very pleasant. The location is in walking distance from Rockefeller, Central Park & public transport is easily accessible too. We walked with a stroller & 3 young kids to both those places more than once and anything we needed was right around the block. Thanks so much Chelsea!"

Our biggest problems was: 6th floor walk (brazilians buy a lot of things in USA, that's why it was a thuf mission go up carrying everything lol), the small bathroom (but with the time you fits with it) and the dust (one of us have allergic rhinitis and sneezed a lot). But it was a great stay, we certainly return if we can."

Mia moglie, io e i tre bambini non abbiamo potuto fermarci neanche un minuto per le pessime condizioni in cui abbiamo trovato l'appartamento. Non corrisponde alle foto, perchè le stanze da letto sono molto più piccole di quello che appaiono, piene di suppellettili polverose e in disordine. Il sofa bed è praticamente un divano sporco dove abbiamo dovuto chiedere lenzuola e ci è stato dato un solo lenzuolo. Il bagno è una latrina minuscola tanto è vero che non appare nelle foto pubblicate. Non abbiamo potuto dormire neanche una notte perché non c'è neanche un cassetto o un armadio vuoto in cui poter stipare i propri effetti. Abbiamo pagato per tre notti oltre 800 euro, non abbiamo passato neanche venti minuti in quella casa, abbiamo dovuto trovare all'1 di notte un'altra sistemazione a New YorK - per cinque persone, compresi due bambini minori - e Chelsea non ci ha risarcito neanche un euro. Veramente un comportamento deprecabile da parte sua."
